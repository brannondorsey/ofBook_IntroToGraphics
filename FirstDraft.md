You might be wondering why we would start with making digital brushes?   

We will get coding as soon as possible and survive this chapter together.

To get started creating brushes, we need to find the basic building blocks of graphics.

The predefines shapes are rectangles, circles, triangles and straight lines.  The freeform shapes are polygons and paths.
